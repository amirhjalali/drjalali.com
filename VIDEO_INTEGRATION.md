# Video Integration Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to add real Dr. Ali Akbar Jalali videos to the Media section of the website.

## Current Status
The MediaSection component now shows professional placeholder content instead of rickroll videos. Each video needs to be replaced with actual YouTube content featuring Dr. Jalali.

## Finding Video IDs

### YouTube Video ID Format
YouTube video IDs are the part after `watch?v=` in the URL:
- Full URL: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123xyz`
- Video ID: `ABC123xyz`

### Where to Find Dr. Jalali's Videos

1. **Official YouTube Channel**: https://www.youtube.com/@Professor.Aliakbar.Jalali
2. **University Channels**: Search Iran University of Science and Technology channels
3. **Conference Videos**: Look for IEEE, UNESCO, or technical conference presentations
4. **Interview Channels**: Persian/English tech interview channels
5. **Educational Platforms**: Academic lecture repositories

### Search Terms to Use
- "Ali Akbar Jalali"

## How to Update Videos

### Step 1: Find Real Videos
Search for videos featuring Dr. Jalali using the methods above.

### Step 2: Extract Video IDs
From each YouTube URL, extract the video ID:
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
                                 â†‘
                          This is the video ID
```

### Step 3: Update the Code
In `src/components/MediaSection.tsx`, replace the placeholder IDs:

```typescript
// Replace this:
youtubeId: 'ACTUAL_VIDEO_ID_1'

// With real video ID:
youtubeId: 'real_video_id_here'
```
