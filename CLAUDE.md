# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a fresh repository for drjalali.com - a personal website project. The repository is currently empty with no existing code structure.

## Development Setup

No build system, package manager, or development tools have been configured yet. Future setup will depend on the technology stack chosen for the website.

## Commands

No build, test, or lint commands are currently available. These should be added as the project develops.

## Architecture

No code architecture exists yet. This section should be updated once the project structure is established.

## Notes for Future Development

- This is a clean slate repository ready for initial project setup
- Consider the technology stack (e.g., static site generator, framework, CMS) before adding files
- Update this CLAUDE.md file as the project structure evolves
- Add build/test/lint commands to this file once they are established
